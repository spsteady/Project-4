You've spent too much time on this project already, take a break. You can work on it on weekends.

Come back to this project after submission to work on better Sass coding.

- combine button and grid, but hover on button only...check into map-merge 

- work on mixins, namely center-container, I know there's got to be a better way

- look for areas to maybe apply a function...

- media query break...is that all there really is? I mean it's only one break, and everything is already inlcuded in that partial, so maybe?

- figure out something to condense the media query partial file, namely with the flex-basis cols

- go back to very first profile page project and integrate principles learned....or start a new one...not sure yet.

- start using the headings and separators in other projects that were used in this one...I like the overall appearance of it. Two line spaces after each heading.  Two line spaces before and after separators.
